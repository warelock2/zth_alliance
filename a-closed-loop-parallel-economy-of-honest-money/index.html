We are creating a network of point of sale systems that feed anonymized sales invoices into in an easily searchable, resilient, locationless database, immune from being shut down, even by nation-states. These point of sale systems manage a separate inventory of items priced not in fiat currencies, such as the US dollar, but rather in honest currencies such as physical weight of gold and silver, along with the Pirate Chain privacy crytocurrency. We fully expect everyone to keep using banks and fiat currencies, such as the US Dollar, on a daily basis for most of their needs. Instead of your current, 100% compliance with government and bank-controlled systems that work against you, we're advocating a slight, initial reduction to 95% compliance. This means that you could start with having just 5% of your goods and services being priced in honest currencies, such as physical weight in silver or in Pirate Chain privacy cryptocurrency. As you start to see the practical reality of honest money in your life, we forsee a natural expansion of this percentage as healthy and inevitable.</p><h1 id="mcetoc_1ikoulou63a">Closed-Loop</h1><p>The main concept here is the fact that it's a closed-loop monetary system. The aim is to directly inject these honest currencies with value from goods and services. Instead of purchasing these honest currencies with dishonest currencies where one might be tempted/distracted, by some future goal of getting a return in those same dishonest currencies, the goal is to retain that value in this closed-loop system and spend it directly on local needs in your own neighborhood. Examples of this would be where you could fill your gas tank, buy groceries, and do the things you normally would do on a daily basis. Pairing offline precious metals with online cryptocurrency, you also get the benefit of being able to settle debts globally, online, via the Pirate Chain privacy cryptocurrency. Only the Pirate Chain privacy cryptocurrency offers perfect privacy and anonymity, which in turn provides perfect fungibility. No other cryptocurrency can honestly make these claims.</p><h1 id="mcetoc_1ikoulou63b">The Unrealized Need for a Market</h1><p>Prior attempts have been made with such systems as "Ithaca hours". However, instead of being some kind of simple, publicly transparent accounting system, we aim to use things like gold and silver, which have been historically used directly as money. Cryptocurrency, in the form of Bitcoin, was created to be such a replacement for dishonest currencies, such as the US Dollar. However, simply creating a new, decentralized currency was not enough to realize this dream. What it lacked was a free market with price visibility, truly free of all banks and governments. We aim to change that.</p><h1 id="mcetoc_1ikoulou63c">Our Design Choices</h1><p>Currently, we are developing the technology to make this dream a reality. We already have complete point of sale systems that process transactions of items priced directly in the weight of silver and in Pirate Chain privacy cryptocurrency. All of these honest currencies we focus on share a single, critical property: They all leave exactly zero public, personally identifying transaction history behind. Some attempts at such privacy and anonymity have been made, most notably Monero. While these first attempts at privacy and anonymity were all that existed at the time, they were not feature-complete. Pirate Chain privacy cryptocurrency was the first to combine the superior Zero Knowledge Proofs technology of Zcash with the 100% mandatory privacy of Monero.</p><h1 id="mcetoc_1ikoulou63d">Your Role</h1><p>What we need right now are early-adopter merchants and customers who already understand and value Honest Money. Partnering with Overt Enigma Freelance services, we can now offer complete point of sale systems, soon to be joined together into a dynamic, closed-loop financial system capable of achieving complete independence from taxation and inflation. With inflation currently running rampant, driving up prices for all, we aim to provide relief from this disastrous debacle.</p><h1 id="mcetoc_1ikoulou63e">A Call to Action: Builders and Doers</h1><p>Please look our website over and click the "Join Us" link at the top of our website to join our growing Discord Chat community.
