The ZTH Alliance also discourages the use of fiat currencies such as the US Dollar, in favor of earning it for goods and services, as well as directly spending it on goods and services, in one's local neighborhood.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1ihee2ko89q">What are the benefits of joining the ZTH Alliance?</h2><p>Creating a portion of your life free from banks and governments gives you the alternate, positive choices for how you get what you need on a daily basis in your own neighborhood. Imagine getting paid for work you do in gold, paying in silver to fill the gasoline/petrol tank of your car, and being able to send money electronically and globally at the speed of email, without paying fees. No more waiting three days for the ACH system to "clear" your check.</p><p>By not automatically using fiat currencies such as the US Dollar, you avoid automatically and completely giving in and supporting several government-sponsored, destructive shenanigans, aimed at violating the public trust at your expense:</p><ul><li>Taxation</li><li>Endless, wasteful, unnecessary government spending</li><li>Inflation, which in and of itself is also a "hidden" tax</li><li>Endless, pointless, destructive wars</li><li>Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), turning money into expiring "coupons"</li><li>Social credit score systems, so popularly used in repressive regiemes like China</li></ul><h1 id="mcetoc_1ihebvm7k45">Risk Management: Legality</h1><h2 id="mcetoc_1ihec2ian4l">In general, is this legal?</h2><blockquote><p>DISCLAIMER: The ZTH Alliance does not give out legal advice. We suggest that you follow all laws in your jurisdiction. If you want proper, professional answers to your legal questions, please consult a lawyer.</p></blockquote><p>Having said that, since ancient times governments and banks have worked to actively destroy the public trust responsibility the public charged them with. Financial control of the public is really just a system of control. They will always want you to submit to that control. It is up to you to use their "Legal Tender" or not. It is up to you to comply or not.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1ihee2ko89r">What is "Legal Tender"?</h2><p>If you open your wallet or purse and take out a US bank note, you'll see the words written on it, "This note is <strong>Legal Tender</strong> for all debts, public and private." Most people don't know what the term "Legal Tender" means. The word "Legal" here means "the force of government" and "Tender" means to offer to another person, similar to "tendering one's resignation" when quitting a job.</p><p>When you buy something, the financial transaction either incurs a debt or does not. For example, if you go to a bar and run up a tab, you're incurring a debt, which you must settle with the bartender. This is considered a "<strong>postpaid</strong>" transaction. If you pay for your drinks up front, not running up a tab, you've incurred no debt, as the bartender won't let you drink your order without first paying. This is considered a "<strong>prepaid</strong>" transaction. The difference here is critical.</p><p>If a customer incurs a debt during a postpaid transaction, regardless of whether the merchant accepts US Dollars, and the customer merely offers "Legal Tender" fiat currency, a judge will always side with the customer, agreeing that the customer satisfied their debt. This practically amounts to the customer using the "force of the guns of government" to force the merchant to accept US Dollars. However, <strong>if no debt was incurred, the merchant can refuse to take US Dollars in favor of literally anything else they want to set the price in.</strong> The judge will always side with the merchant, charging the customer with theft if they walk off with the goods and/or services without paying.</p><p>By carefully avoiding your customers incurring debt to you and only doing "prepaid" transactions, you as a merchant are complely and legally free to set your prices in literally anything you wish, including in gold, silver, cryptocurrency, sticks, stones, or seashells.</p><blockquote><p>ATTENTION: Even though both merhant and customer can agree to transact in whatever they want, the US government classifies anything other than cash as an "asset", subject to Capital Gains tax. This is clearly a form of discrimiation against anything that isn't government-controlled, fiat currency such as the US Dollar.</p></blockquote><h1 id="mcetoc_1ihec0lb24g">How: Technical/Procedural/Cost</h1><h2 id="mcetoc_1ihec0lb24h">How do I know that the precious metal coins are authentic?</h2><p>We recommend using the same electronic precious metals verifier devices that coin shops use. These devices allow you to instantly verify the purity of items like jewelry, coins, or bars through and through, even through a plastic sleeve. Combined with a simple, calibrated weight scale, it is nearly impossible to miss a fake coin, even if it were merely plated with precious metal.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img src="https://zthalliance.com/media/posts/10/instant_assay_01-lg.jpg" alt="Precious metals verifier device" width="568" height="460" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://zthalliance.com/media/posts/10/responsive/instant_assay_01-lg-xs.jpg 640w, https://zthalliance.com/media/posts/10/responsive/instant_assay_01-lg-sm.jpg 768w, https://zthalliance.com/media/posts/10/responsive/instant_assay_01-lg-md.jpg 1024w, https://zthalliance.com/media/posts/10/responsive/instant_assay_01-lg-lg.jpg 1366w, https://zthalliance.com/media/posts/10/responsive/instant_assay_01-lg-xl.jpg 1600w, https://zthalliance.com/media/posts/10/responsive/instant_assay_01-lg-2xl.jpg 1920w"></figure><p>Such a device is comparable in cost to quality credit card swiping point of sale systems, except that it's offline, requiring no internet service to function, and requires exactly zero service fees. Purchasing these devices is a one-time cost.</p><p>An example of how to successfully test the weight and purity of a supposedly one troy ounce silver round of supposedly 0.999 purity:</p><ol><li>Turn the precious metals verifier unit on</li><li>Press the "Cal" button to perform a mandatory, initial device sensor calibration</li><li>Press the "Metal" button and use the keypad arrow keys to navigate through the menu screens to select "Pure Silver"</li><li>Press the "Measure" button</li><li>Place the silver round on the white surface under the left, plastic bridge in the upper left of the device's surface</li><li>If both indicators on the screen show surface and internal purity in the green, then proceed</li><li>Press the "Measure" button to switch to "Dim" (physical dimension) mode</li><li>Use the keypad to tell the device the thing being tested is round and not rectangular</li><li>Place the silver round such that the right edge lines up with the dotted line as indicated by the glowing LED and see if the left edge is within the green bar as displayed on the screen</li><li>If the physical measurement is acceptable, then the item is pure, through and through</li><li>Place the silver round on the calibrated weight scale and verify that it does indeed weigh one troy ounce</li></ol><blockquote><p>NOTE: This procedure takes only a few seconds, which is even quicker than it takes to get a single, one-minute confirmation of a Pirate Chain cryptocurrency transaction.</p></blockquote><h2 id="mcetoc_1ihec0lb24i">Can't I just use some other way to test the coins?</h2><p>While you're free to try to use other methods to test for purity, traditional tests such as using acid will only tell you about the purity of the outer surface of the coin. Traditionally to know if a coin was fake on the inside, you'd have to do a full melt assay, which of course destroys the coin's form.</p><p>Coin shops use non-destructive, electronic purity testing combined with using a calibrated weight scale. The ZTH Alliance mandates that both merchants and customers purchase weight scales and precious metals verifier devices. The goal here is to stop supporting the common, bad habit of trusting whatever is written or stamped on currency and simply verifying it for yourself. This is what keeps the currency honest.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1iheib4jk1aa">Describe the workflow of a typical customer purchase using honest money</h2><ol><li>Merchant offers an item for sale, but the price is not denominated in US Dollars, but in a weight of a precious metal, such as silver. Example: Six gallons of gasoline/petrol for one Troy ounce of pure silver.</li><li>Customer slightly overpays for five gallons of gasoline/petrol with a single "round" of one Troy ounce of pure silver.</li><li>In seconds, the merchant successfully confirms the weight and purity of the silver using their weight scale and precious metals verifier device.</li><li>Satisfied with the weight and purity of the silver, the merchant allocates five gallons of gasoline/petrol to be dispensed at the customer's designated pump.</li><li>The customer opens their Pirate Chain privacy cryptocurrency wallet app on their phone, providing the QR code of their wallet to the merchant.</li><li>The merchant scans the customer's QR code and sends them the change for the transaction in near-infinitely divisible Pirate Chain privacy cryptocurrency.</li><li>During the one minute period that it takes the customer to receive the Pirate Chain privacy cryptocurrency and a single blockchain confirmation of the transaction, the customer fills their gasoline/petrol tank with the five gallons they paid for.</li><li>The customer checks their phone, sees the change in their wallet show up along with at least one blockchain confirmation, telling the customer that the change funds the merchant sent to the customer are pure and valid.</li></ol><h1 id="mcetoc_1ihec0lb24j">Onboarding: Merchants/Customers</h1><h2 id="mcetoc_1iheib4jk1ab">How do I get started?</h2><p>The first step in getting started is to meet with a representative of the ZTH Alliance in person, likely at your place of business. They will help you understand how all of this is supposed to work and either directly answer your questions or point you to online resources to get your questions answered. They will guide you through the following steps, some of which are mandatory to participate in the ZTH Alliance. </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1iheib4jk1ac">Mandatory: Purchase a precious metals verifier device and calibrated, physical weight scale</h3><p>Suitable, portable weight scales are very cheap and easily available. A precious metals verifier device costs something similar to a quality credit card swiping point of sale device, commonly available. These devices are offline, requiring no internet service, or transaction service fees, forever. This is a one-time purchase. These precious metals verifier devices can be purchased through an authorized agent of the ZTH Alliance.</p><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://zthalliance.com/media/posts/10/instant_assay_01-lg-2.jpg" alt="" width="568" height="460" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://zthalliance.com/media/posts/10/responsive/instant_assay_01-lg-2-xs.jpg 640w, https://zthalliance.com/media/posts/10/responsive/instant_assay_01-lg-2-sm.jpg 768w, https://zthalliance.com/media/posts/10/responsive/instant_assay_01-lg-2-md.jpg 1024w, https://zthalliance.com/media/posts/10/responsive/instant_assay_01-lg-2-lg.jpg 1366w, https://zthalliance.com/media/posts/10/responsive/instant_assay_01-lg-2-xl.jpg 1600w, https://zthalliance.com/media/posts/10/responsive/instant_assay_01-lg-2-2xl.jpg 1920w"></figure><h3 id="mcetoc_1iheib4jk1ad">Mandatory: Install the "Skull Island" Pirate Chain privacy cryptocurrency mobile wallet app</h3><p>The zero-cost <a href="https://piratechain.com/wallets/#mobile-wallet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Skull Island" Pirate Chain privacy cryptocurrency mobile app</a> is the native mobile wallet app of the Pirate Chain project. It is available for both Android and iPhone here. This app lets you generate a cryptocurrency wallet wth wallet secret and associated wallet secret backup "seed phrase". The "seed phrase" is a sequence of 24 English words that you physically write down on a piece of paper. You then store the physically written down "seed phrase" in a physically safe place like a bank safe deposit box. The mobile app is considered to be equivalent of your wallet in your back pocket or your purse. You would keep less funds here than in either your desktop wallet or your "cold storage" wallet.</p><blockquote><p><span style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-style: italic; color: var(--text-primary-color); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">ATTENTION: It is extremely important that you never simply copy/paste your wallet secret backup "seed phrase" using your phone's or your PC's clipboard feature. Doing so sets you up for having your funds stolen by criminals. Never show your "seed phrase" to anyone, as this can be used to "recover" your cryptocurrency wallet and all of the funds in it. This recovery procedure must only be done by you, in order to protect your funds from theft.</span></p></blockquote><h3 id="mcetoc_1iheib4jk1ae">Optional, but recommended: Install the "Treasure Chest" Pirate Chain privacy cryptocurrency full node desktop app</h3><p>The zero-cost <a href="https://piratechain.com/wallets/#full-node-wallet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Treasure Chest" Pirate Chain privacy cryptocurrency full node desktop app</a> is the native desktop wallet app of the Pirate Chain project. It is available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. This app lets you generate a cryptocurrency wallet wth wallet secret and associated wallet secret backup "seed phrase". The "seed phrase" is a sequence of 24 English words that you physically write down on a piece of paper. It also uses your PC to expand and strengthen the Pirate Chain privacy cryptocurrency blockchain network. Doing so requires that you keep the Pirate Chain running at least in a background state, minimized to your desktop "system tray" area. The desktop app is considered to be equivalent of a checking account in a conventional bank. You would keep more funds here than in your mobile wallet, less funds here than in your "cold storage" wallet.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1iheib4jk1af">Optional, but recommended: Purchase a Pirate Plus Pirate Chain privacy cryptocurrency "cold storage" hardware wallet device</h3><p>The "Pirate Plus" Pirate Chain privacy cryptocurrency "cold storage" hareware wallet device is unique in that it the only "cold storage" device that has the resources needed to create a Pirate Chain privacy cryptocurency wallet offline. It is the safest way to store Pirate Chain privacy cryptocurrency and when properly used, makes your funds immune to being stolen by online criminals. Physically, the device has an LCD display screen, is powered by a micro USB connector, and has no direct input, relying on a desktop "helper app" that you install and run on your PC. This device lets you generate a cryptocurrency wallet wth wallet secret and associated wallet secret backup "seed phrase". The "seed phrase" is a sequence of 24 English words that you physically write down on a piece of paper. The device is considered to be equivalent of a savings account in a conventional bank. You would keep more funds here than in both your mobile wallet and in your desktop wallet. The "Pirate Plus" Pirate Chain privacy cryptocurrency "cold storage" hardware wallet device can be purchased through an authorized agent of the ZTH Alliance.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img src="https://zthalliance.com/media/posts/10/pirate_plus_hardware_wallet.jpg" alt="" width="344" height="331" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://zthalliance.com/media/posts/10/responsive/pirate_plus_hardware_wallet-xs.jpg 640w, https://zthalliance.com/media/posts/10/responsive/pirate_plus_hardware_wallet-sm.jpg 768w, https://zthalliance.com/media/posts/10/responsive/pirate_plus_hardware_wallet-md.jpg 1024w, https://zthalliance.com/media/posts/10/responsive/pirate_plus_hardware_wallet-lg.jpg 1366w, https://zthalliance.com/media/posts/10/responsive/pirate_plus_hardware_wallet-xl.jpg 1600w, https://zthalliance.com/media/posts/10/responsive/pirate_plus_hardware_wallet-2xl.jpg 1920w"></figure><h3 id="mcetoc_1iheib4jk1ag">Optional, but recommended: Purchase a wallet backup "seed phrase" secret storage device made of steel</h3><p>When you securely store your "seed phrase" that you physically wrote down on a piece of paper, storing it in a safe place like a bank safe deposit box, you safeguard your exclusive means of restoring your cryptocurrency funds in case of loss of cryptocurrency wallet. However, if that secure storage place is subject to the destruction of fire or flood, that extremely important paper is at risk of being damaged beyond repair. To safeguard against this, you can purchase a steel device the size of an audio cassette that has tiny, metal letters you slide into, scrabble-style that spell out all of the "seed phrase" words you had previously only written down paper. Once transferred, you then burn the "seed phrase" paper. You then store the steel "seed phrase" storage unit in your bank safe deposit box instead. Your cryptocurrency funds are now safe from both fire and flood. Such devices are available from an authorized agent of the ZTH Alliance.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img src="https://zthalliance.com/media/posts/10/steel_seed_words_storage_device-2.png" alt="" width="268" height="326" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://zthalliance.com/media/posts/10/responsive/steel_seed_words_storage_device-2-xs.png 640w, https://zthalliance.com/media/posts/10/responsive/steel_seed_words_storage_device-2-sm.png 768w, https://zthalliance.com/media/posts/10/responsive/steel_seed_words_storage_device-2-md.png 1024w, https://zthalliance.com/media/posts/10/responsive/steel_seed_words_storage_device-2-lg.png 1366w, https://zthalliance.com/media/posts/10/responsive/steel_seed_words_storage_device-2-xl.png 1600w, https://zthalliance.com/media/posts/10/responsive/steel_seed_words_storage_device-2-2xl.png 1920w"></figure><h3 id="mcetoc_1iheicanj1aj">Optional, but recommended: Get a private "safe deposit" box at a secure, private storage facility</h3><p>Historically, banks were the default choice for storing valuables in "safe deposit" boxes in the bank's vault. However as banks are heavily regulated, the mere fact that you have a safe deposit box is reported to the government. This puts your items at risk of being seized any time the government decides to.</p><p>To safeguard against this, you can instead get an equivalent private safe deposit box at a private company with a similar valut. Storing your valuables there does not subject you to the regulatory compliance banks have to conform to. Your valuables, including your "seed phrase" backup paper/steel words device are now safe from casual looting by government regulators. An authorized agent of the ZTH Alliance can help you get established with such a private storage service in your area, if available.</p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>.</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://zthalliance.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://zthalliance.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script></body></html>
