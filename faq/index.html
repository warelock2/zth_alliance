Financial control of the public is really just a system of control. They will always want you to submit to that control. It is up to you to comply or not.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1ihc8bpnn2m">How do I know that the precious metal coins are authentic?</h3><p>We recommend using the same electronic precious metals verifier devices that coin shops use. These devices allow you to instantly verify the purity of items like jewelry, coins, or bars through and through, even through a plastic sleeve. Combined with a simple, calibrated weight scale, it is nearly impossible to miss a fake coin, even if it were merely plated with precious metal.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1ihc8bpnn2n">Can't I just use some other way to test the coins?</h3><p>While you're free to try to use other methods to test for purity, traditional tests such as using acid will only tell you about the purity of the outer surface of the coin. Traditionally to know if a coin was fake on the inside, you'd have to do a full melt assay, which of course destroys the coin's form.</p><p>Coin shops use non-destructive, electronic purity testing combined with using a calibrated weight scale.</p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>.</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://zthalliance.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://zthalliance.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script></body></html>
