However in a \"public key cryptography\" sense, \"crypto\" only seems to borrow from the \"digital signatures\" transparent aspect, rather than the \"encryption\" privacy aspect. This runs counter to the original ethos of Bitcoin, which was to create a cash replacement. Without real privacy and anonymity, \"crypto\" can only be used as an investment and not as a cash replacement. Unfortunately, this made the world of \"crypto\" vulnerable to the \"get rich quick\" vultures of traditional finance, resulting in stupid tropes like \"number go up\", \"wen crypto Lambo, bruh?\", \"Mooning\", and \"HODL\". Pro tip: If you're dreaming of exiting a crypto investment to get your \"fat stacks\" of fiat currency, you never cared about the crypto to begin with.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1j4p3tnnb54\">Counterculture</h1>\n<p>The 1960s saw the formation of the \"hippie\" counterculture movement in the US. The 1970s saw the formation of the \"punk\" counterculture movement across the world.  A single term that encompasses the punk counterculture movement for both online and offline currencies is \"Countercurrencies\" (or \"Counter culture currencies\"). An equivalent term for this is also \"Punkcurrencies\".</p>\n<p>The \"Cipherpunk\" (sometimes spelled \"Cypherpunk\", a mashup between \"Cipher\" from Cryptography and \"Cyberpunk\" from 1980s Science Fiction novels) movement spearheaded many counter culture privacy and anonymity technologies that form the underpinning of our current online world, without which our world wouldn't exist in the form that it does.</p>\n<p>The rebellious \"punk\" ethos of \"Cipherpunk\", applied to the world of finance, amounts to these four stages:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Skepticism</strong>: Question the default financial order, whether it's fiat, banks, or corporate-controlled ledgers.</li>\n<li><strong>Resistance</strong>: Challenge centralized or coercive authority.</li>\n<li><strong>Privacy</strong> / <strong>Anonymity</strong>: Obscure your transactions from oversight.</li>\n<li><strong>Autonomy</strong>: Control your own money, free from intermediaries.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1j4p41gme56\">A Difference in Kind, not Degree</h1>\n<p><strong>I propose that instead of using the term \"crypto\" for Pirate Chain, we use the term \"cipher\" instead. </strong>\"Cipher\" denotes \"Cipherpunk\", which denotes critical and mandatory privacy and anonymity. This means that only Pirate Chain can be used as a proper cash replacement.</p>\n<p>This also means that all blockchain technology applied to being used as a financial instrument other than Pirate Chain is useless, destructive, and to be avoided at all costs. This includes Bitcoin, Zcash, Monero, and every other clone of Bitcoin that adds zero value. This also includes everything that calls itself or is called \"crypto\".</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1j4p41tlm58\">Online vs. Offline</h1>\n<p>While \"cipher\" is online currency with actual privacy and anonymity, there are offline currencies that came before it that are still just as private and anonymous: Physical gold, physical silver. These other currencies are just as \"punk\" in their ethos as Pirate Chain is. The difference is that online currencies are numbers representing secrets hiding behind hard math problems, leveraged into being financial instruments. Offline currencies such as precious metals instead rely on physical reality. If you want to know if precious metal is pure, you test it. If you want to know how much you have, you weigh it. You never need to trust the stamping or printing on it.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1j4p428q05a\">Got Punk?</h1>\n<p>Terminology and definitions being proposed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cipher (or Ciphercurrency)</strong>: Online privacy and anonymity currency suitable for use as a cash replacement. There is only one ciphercurrency: Pirate Chain.</li>\n<li><strong>Cipherpunk</strong>: A technology movement, originating in the 1990s, with a rebellious \"punk\" ethos, using Cryptography to achieve individual empowerment and autonomy against centralised, oppressive systems of authority, including nation states. It gave us the likes of PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), still widely used today. The term \"Cipherpunk\" is a mashup of \"Cipher\" from \"Cryptography\" and \"punk\" from the science fiction \"Cyberpunk\" literary genre.</li>\n<li><strong>Crypto (or Cryptocurrencies)</strong>: All blockchain technology used to create financial instruments that have no real privacy and anonymity and are therefore not suitable for use as a cash replacement. This excludes Pirate Chain.</li>\n<li><strong>Countercurrencies</strong> / <strong>Punkcurrencies</strong>: A general term for all online and offline currencies that have <strong>actual privacy and anonymity</strong>, which are suitable for use as a cash replacement, which includes physical gold, physical silver, and Pirate Chain Ciphercurrency. This references the rebellious \"punk\" counterculture and the \"Cipherpunk\" technology movement.</li>\n<li><strong>Compliancecurrencies</strong>: A general term for all online and offline currencies that have neither privacy nor anonymity, which are <strong>aimed at getting you and keeping you compliant with centralised systems of control</strong>. These include fiat currencies such as the US Dollar, crypto (including \"Genius Act\" stablecoins, but excluding Pirate Chain, since it's not crypto, it's cipher), and even cash, since cash can be inflated and controlled by banks and governments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using these terms, we can now easily say that <strong>all crypto is shit</strong>, without harming the brand of Pirate Chain. For example, \"CBDCs are coming and crypto will not save you. However, cipher (and countercurrencies) will.\"<br><br><strong>Bitcoin got no punk. Zcash got no punk. Monero got no punk. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Pirate Chain, physical gold, and physical silver are NOTHING BUT PUNK.</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zthalliance.com/join-us/\">Click here to join us!</a></p>",

We are creating a network of point of sale systems that feed anonymized sales invoices into in an easily searchable, resilient, locationless database, immune from being shut down, even by nation-states. These point of sale systems manage a separate inventory of items priced not in compliancecurrencies, such as the US dollar, but rather in honest countercurrencies such as physical weight of gold and silver, along with the Pirate Chain privacy ciphercurrency. We fully expect everyone to keep using banks and fiat compliancecurrencies, such as the US Dollar, on a daily basis for most of their needs. Instead of your current, 100% compliance with government and bank-controlled systems that work against you, we're advocating a slight, initial reduction to 95% compliance. This means that you could start with having just 5% of your goods and services being priced in honest countercurrencies, such as physical weight in silver or in Pirate Chain privacy ciphercurrency. As you start to see the practical reality of honest countercurrency money in your life, we forsee a natural expansion of this percentage as healthy and inevitable.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1ikoulou63a\">Closed-Loop</h1>\n<p>The main concept here is the fact that it's a closed-loop monetary system. The aim is to directly inject these honest countercurrencies with value from goods and services. Instead of purchasing these honest countercurrencies with dishonest compliancecurrencies where one might be tempted/distracted, by some future goal of getting a return in those same dishonest countercurrencies, the goal is to retain that value in this closed-loop system and spend it directly on local needs in your own neighborhood. Examples of this would be where you could fill your gas tank, buy groceries, and do the things you normally would do on a daily basis. Pairing offline precious metals with online ciphercurrency, you also get the benefit of being able to settle debts globally, online, via the Pirate Chain privacy ciphercurrency. Only the Pirate Chain privacy ciphercurrency offers perfect privacy and anonymity, which in turn provides perfect fungibility. No other cryptocurrency can honestly make these claims as they all either don't care about privacy or use inferior privacy technology.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1ikoulou63b\">The Unrealized Need for a Market</h1>\n<p>Prior attempts at closed-loop, local economies have been made with such systems as \"Ithaca hours\". However, instead of being some kind of simple, publicly transparent accounting system, we aim to use countercurrencies like physical gold and physical silver, which have been historically used directly as money. Cryptocurrency, in the form of Bitcoin, was created to be such a replacement for dishonest currencies, such as the US Dollar. However, simply creating a new, decentralized currency was not enough to realize this dream. What it lacked was a free market with price visibility, truly free of all banks and governments. We aim to change that.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1ikoulou63c\">Our Design Choices</h1>\n<p>Currently, we are developing the technology to make this dream a reality. We already have complete point of sale systems that process transactions of items priced directly in countercurrencies such as the physical weight of silver and in Pirate Chain privacy ciphercurrency. All of these honest countercurrencies we focus on share a single, critical property: They all leave exactly zero public, personally identifying transaction history behind. Some attempts at such privacy and anonymity have been made, most notably Monero. While these first attempts at privacy and anonymity were all that existed at the time, they were not and are not privacy feature-complete. Pirate Chain privacy ciphercurrency was the first to combine the superior Zero Knowledge Proofs technology of Zcash cryptocurrency with the 100% mandatory privacy of Monero.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1ikoulou63d\">Your Role</h1>\n<p>What we need right now are early-adopter merchants and customers who already understand and value Honest Money. Partnering with Overt Enigma Freelance services, we can now offer complete point of sale systems, soon to be joined together into a dynamic, closed-loop financial system capable of achieving complete independence from taxation and inflation. With inflation currently running rampant, driving up prices for all, we aim to provide relief from this disastrous debacle.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1ikoulou63e\">A Call to Action: Builders and Doers</h1>\n<p>Please look our website over and click the \"Join Us\" link at the top of our website to join our growing Discord Chat community. There, we work together to finish the privacy and anonymity job that cryptocurrency started. Help us build a financial world you want to not just survive in, but can thrive in and live well. Don't just spectate. Break your habits of being distracted by technology and help us build a new, better future. It all depends on you.

We are a group of people who are interested in using international currencies with \"Zero Transaction History\", locally in our own neighborhoods, excluding all banks and all governments, to build a new, parallel economy bridging the old financial world and the new, joining the global world of technology to the local world we all live in, on a purely practical level to enhance our lives to the maximum possible levels of Liberty.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1iehver9m3jh\">Bringing Financial Privacy into the Modern World</h1>\n<p>Traditionally, precious metals such as physical gold and silver have been used to transact in such a private manner, as they have no history of ownership and leave no public transaction history behind. Unfortunately, you can't email a gallon of gas. Neither can you email physical gold and silver. Almost all cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, Monero, and the like, were designed for this purpose, but due to unbelievably bad design and a myriad of other destructive distractions, are completely unsuitable. All cryptocurrencies are nothing more than the sticks and seashells used by cave men, just like the worthless paper currencies we hold in our wallets/purses. There is only ONE ciphercurrency that has the same \"Zero Transaction History\" property as physical gold and silver: <a href=\"https://piratechain.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pirate Chain</a>.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1iehver9m3ji\">Pirate Chain Privacy Ciphercurrency</h1>\n<p>The \"<a href=\"https://piratechain.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pirate Chain</a>\" ciphercurrency is unique in the digital currency space, such that it combines the superior privacy/anonymity-preserving technology of \"Zero Knowledge Proofs\" with 100% mandatory privacy for each transaction, with no exception. This differentiates it from all other trash cryptocurrencies, including but not limited to Bitcoin, Zcash, and Monero. In our view, <a href=\"https://piratechain.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pirate Chain</a> is the only ciphercurrency worth using, with all others to be avoided like the plague.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1iehver9n3jj\">Why Not Just Use Cash?</h1>\n<p>While government-issued \"fiat currencies\" like the US Dollar also have been used to transact in such a manner, you also get risks of inflation, taxation, and the fueling of endless wars. Additionally US Dollars, like many other government-issued currencies, have individual serial numbers, which could in theory be used to track and trace any purchases made with them.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1iehver9n3jk\">Why Not Just Use Monero Instead of Pirate Chain?</h1>\n<p>Shortly after Bitcoin was created, Monero was a first, early attempt at providing privacy through obscurity. All cybersecurity professionals know that it is impossible to achieve security through obscurity. They are not the same and never will be. Monero's inferior \"Ring CT\" \"decoy\" technology does the equivalent of trying to merely \"hide\" your money by sticking it out of sight in a desk drawer, rather than in a secure bank vault, out of the hands of thieves and government snoops. While Monero was designed to provide \"privacy by default\", disabling all transparent, public transactions, there are far superior choices like <a href=\"https://piratechain.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pirate Chain</a> privacy ciphercurrency that are simply a quantum leap forward in security, privacy, and anonymity. <a href=\"https://piratechain.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pirate Chain</a> is the only ciphercurrency, such that it provides PERFECT fungibility, the property that makes your money immune to being discriminated against, due to any prior ownership history. <a href=\"https://piratechain.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pirate Chain</a> is therefore the only valid choice for a digital currency, since only it can be used as a digital cash replacement.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1iehver9n3jl\">From Buy/Invest/Sell to Earn/Spend/Live</h1>\n<p>All too often, countercurrencies like physical gold, physical silver, and even Pirate Chain ciphercurrency have been tied to an \"investing/hoarding\" mindset, where these \"investors\" dream of exiting said investment currency (ie. physical gold, Bitcoin, Monero), for some kind of future, higher amount of the original currency invested (ie. US Dollars).</p>\n<p>HARSH TRUTH FOR CRYPTOCURRENCY \"INVESTORS\": We here at the ZTH Alliance recognize the harsh truth that anyone who invests like this, dreaming of exiting that investment with \"fat stacks\" of profit, never really cared about the currency they were investing in to begin with.</p>\n<p>A unique, superior, alternative approach exists, having nothing to do with this \"investing/hoarding\" mindset, that sets one free from banks, governments, inflation, taxation, and endless wars. Instead of buying honest coutercurrecies like physical gold, physical silver, and Pirate Chain with tainted \"fiat\" currencies like the US Dollar, one trades one's labor or goods, <em>earning</em> that honest money. Keeping it in a separate pile, this becomes a sort of \"clean spot\" in one's life, without the stink of banks and governments. The idea then is to locate <em>local</em> vendors who have joined the ZTH Alliance, who provide commonly needed goods and services necessary for daily life: Filling up your gas tank, buying groceries, paying bills.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1iehver9n3jn\">Bank-Free and Government-Free Prices</h1>\n<p>When you go to the store, you've always seen prices listed in your country's \"fiat\" currency, such as the US Dollar. ZTH Alliance members strongly desire to see and provide prices that have nothing to do with Banks and Governments. While no customer or merchant would or be expected to \"quit their day job\" over this, abandoning \"fiat\" currencies altogether, the idea here is to pursue this in a sort of \"side gig\" sense. You want to keep your pile of honest money separate from your other money.</p>\n<p>As a merchant, we advise picking goods and/or services, where you pledge, going forward, to NEVER price them traditionally in a \"fiat\" currency, such as the US Dollar, keeping them in a sort of separate \"clean spot pile\".</p>\n<p>For goods, you would price them in one of the three ZTH Alliance-approved coutercurrencies: Physical gold, Physical Silver, <a href=\"https://piratechain.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pirate Chain</a> privacy ciphercurrency. An example based on buying one gallon of gasoline for your car:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One gallon of gasoline for 11 <a href=\"https://piratechain.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pirate Chain</a></li>\n<li>11 gallons of gasoline for a one Troy ounce of 0.999 physical silver \"round\" </li>\n</ul>\n<p>For services, you would do the same, but price them in units of time like hours, or per job, as you normally would.</p>\n<p>For currency exchanges, you would then form prices from a pair of the three ZTH Alliance-approved coutercurrencies: Physical gold, physical silver, <a href=\"https://piratechain.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pirate Chain</a> privacy ciphercurrency. Examples would be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A one-Troy ounce \"round\" of 24 karat gold for 9400 <a href=\"https://piratechain.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pirate Chain</a></li>\n<li>9400 <a href=\"https://piratechain.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pirate Chain</a> for a one-Troy ounce \"round\" of 24 karat gold</li>\n<li>A one-Troy ounce \"round\" of 24 karat gold for 818 one-Troy ounce \"rounds\" of 0.999 silver</li>\n<li>A one-Troy ounce \"round\" of 0.999 silver for 112 <a href=\"https://piratechain.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pirate Chain</a></li>\n<li>112 <a href=\"https://piratechain.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pirate Chain</a> for a one-Troy ounce \"round\" of 0.999 silver</li>\n<li>818 one-Troy ounce \"rounds\" of 0.999 silver for a one-Troy ounce \"round\" of 24 karat gold</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1iehver9n3jo\">Avoiding Compliancecurrencies in Prices</h1>\n<p>To maintain the integrity of this separate, parallel, international economy, it is EXTREMELY important one keeps bought, \"tainted\" compliancecurrencies completely separate from earned, \"clean\" countercurrencies. It is also very important to not mix your goods/services together. Keep your ZTH alliance goods and services priced only in countercurrencies like physical gold, physical silver, or <a href=\"https://piratechain.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pirate Chain</a> privacy ciphercurrency.</p>\n<p>To avoid confusion, pick a single honest countercurrency for the price you set and stick to that (ie. for a gallon of gas, set the price either as 11 <a href=\"https://piratechain.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pirate Chain</a>/gal. or as 0.09 Troy ounces of physical silver/gal.). If you know of other local merchants in the ZTH Alliance, you can set your prices competitively against them as your normally would. If however, you are the only such vendor in your local area, as no market price signals are readily available, we suggest setting your initial price by converting it from other \"fiat\" compliancecurrency prices (ie. look up the local price of gas in dollars as set by your competitors). </p>\n<p>It is then EXTREMELY important to try to stick to that price you set. We suggest giving it a set amount of time, like a week, then repeating the process described above. The idea here is that we want to have all prices near-constant and unfluctuating. It's OK to initially tether your price to conventional \"fiat\" market prices, but once other local merchants have joined the ZTH Alliance in your area, please only use those prices to competitively set yours. This is the only way we will be able to build a parallel economy free of the destructive baggage of Banks and Governments.</p>\n<p>All too often we see \"alternatively\" priced items listed in crypto like Bitcoin, only to be dismayed at seeing these prices wildly fluctuating from second to second. This is caused by setting the underlying price in US Dollars, with some website software constantly looking up the exchange rate of Bitcoins to US Dollars. It is EXTREMELY important that you do not do this. The only way to construct a parallel economy free of Banks and Governments is to absolutely NEVER price any \"clean spot\"/\"side gig\" goods and services in compliancecurrencies like the US Dollar. Leave tainted practices like that for your \"day job\" goods and services, or just simply price those \"day job\" services in some compliancecurrency like US Dollars.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1iehver9n3jp\">Accepting Gold and Silver as Payment</h1>\n<p>As a merchant, you live in a conventional world of things like US Dollars, credit cards, point of sales terminals, and all of their associated fees. If you've ever visited a precious metal coin shop, you would have noticed small, convenient electronic assay equipment the size of a phone or a tablet. Before purchasing any coins, the coin shop merchant simply places the physical gold or physical silver \"round\" you presented them with on the device, getting an instant \"red light/green light\"-type of indication as to whether the item is pure or fake. If it shows up as pure, they then simply weigh it and verify the amount of precious metal, typically one-Troy ounce at a time. If everything is valid, the merchant accepts the transaction and proceeds normally.</p>\n<p>These types of electronic \"instant assay\" devices are readily available and the ZTH Alliance can help you purchase such a point-of-sale device, providing basic instructions on how to use it. Using such a device, you can easily, quickly, and directly accept actual physical gold and physical silver for payment <em>instead</em> of dirty, tainted compliancecurrencies like the US Dollar. These devices can use what are called \"bridges\" to do deep detection of fakes that could have merely been plated with precious metals, hiding fake metals inside. The technology used is fascinating, advanced, extremely convenient, and do not harm precious metals like conventional, imprecise methods like acid can do.</p>\n<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that such a point of sale device is a one-time purchase, in addition to a reliable weight scale. There are no network service fees you would normally have to pay when you use credit card point of sale terminals. These precious metal \"instant assay\" devices are permanently and completely offline, private, and anonymous to use, forever.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1iehver9n3jq\">Accepting Pirate Chain as Payment</h1>\n<p>The simplest way to accept, hold, and send <a href=\"https://piratechain.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pirate Chain</a> privacy ciphercurrency is to install the official \"Skull Island\", zero-cost \"wallet\" app on your current smartphone. These are considered to be the equivalent of the wallet in your back pocket or your cash register. Receiving money is as simple as displaying a QR code generated by the app. Sending money is as simple as scanning said QR code with your phone's camera into the app, filling out the amount, and optionally writing something in the \"memo\" field. Think of this similar to writing a check. Funds held like this on an online device like a phone or a PC are potentially at risk of being hacked, like most everything these days. Other more secure, additional methods are available to safeguard your funds.</p>\n<p>A much more secure additional way to accept, hold, and send <a href=\"https://piratechain.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pirate Chain</a> privacy ciphercurrency is to take advantage of a concept called \"cold storage\". This method requires the use of a very small, fairly inexpensive USB device, the size of two USB memory sticks, side by side. Currently, the only device capable of providing this service is called the closed-source \"Pirate Plus\" cold storage USB hardware wallet. Other open-source hardware wallet device projects are currently in the research and development phase. This method provides you with the equivalent of a savings account, without the normally attached Banks and Governments, with all of their destructive baggage.</p>\n<p>When setting either method up, you are prompted to make a simple backup of the internal secret leveraging your money, by writing some English words on a piece of paper. This allows you to securely store these \"seed phrase\" words in a bank vault, as a permanent means of recovering all of your funds in case the device is lost or stolen. The level of security this provides is far greater than even Fort Knox.</p>\n<p>An additional level of security can be provided by using a small steel device, the size of an old school audio cassette. This device has metal letters you slide into it, similar to what you see when you've played the game \"Scrabble\". Once all of your backup \"seed phrase\" words are loaded into such a metal device, your money becomes immune to physical disasters, such as fire and/or flood, where your paper \"seed phrase\" backup would have been rendered useless.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT: Digital money transactions are never instant. Transfers of <a href=\"https://piratechain.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pirate Chain</a> cipher funds can take a minute or two to show up with their first confirmation. Think of it as the same amount of time it takes to send and receive an email. Each transaction is validated by the digital money network continuously over and over again, but for speedy transfers, it is quite common to accept the validity of a transaction with only one confirmation. That choice is a trade off between assurance and speed, which will always be up to the one receiving the funds to set and require.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1iehver9n3jr\">How Do I Get Started?</h1>\n<p>For merchants, you likely found this website, due to already meeting a ZTH Alliance representative in person, at your establishment. For customers, you may have seen an advertisement for this online or are already part of our online, dedicated Discord chat server. In any case, there is a \"Discord\" invitation link at the top of this website. The Discord chat service is free, but does require you to create an account when you sign up. We recommend joining our Discord chat server and reaching out to Discord server administrator \"warelock\" for more information.</p>\n<p>Typically for a merchant to get started, the merchant reaches out via Discord or simply had provided their phone number to the representative they'd already met. A ZTH Alliance representative will then reach out and initiate the order of the required precious metal \"instant assay\" point of sale device. A reliable weigh scale is also required. We will then walk you through the process of installing the \"<a href=\"https://piratechain.com/wallets/#mobile-wallet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Skull Island</a>\" phone app and how to bring up a QR code for receiving payment from a customer.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><figure class=\"post__image\"><img  src=\"https://zthalliance.com/media/posts/1/instant_assay_01.jpg\" alt=\"&quot;Point-of-Sale&quot; Instant Electronic Assay (about the size of an iPad tablet)\" width=\"568\" height=\"460\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://zthalliance.com/media/posts/1/responsive/instant_assay_01-xs.jpg 640w ,https://zthalliance.com/media/posts/1/responsive/instant_assay_01-sm.jpg 768w ,https://zthalliance.com/media/posts/1/responsive/instant_assay_01-md.jpg 1024w ,https://zthalliance.com/media/posts/1/responsive/instant_assay_01-lg.jpg 1366w ,https://zthalliance.com/media/posts/1/responsive/instant_assay_01-xl.jpg 1600w ,https://zthalliance.com/media/posts/1/responsive/instant_assay_01-2xl.jpg 1920w\"></figure>\n<figcaption >\"Point-of-Sale\" Instant Electronic Assay (about the size of an iPad tablet)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Additional possible applications of this \"instant assay\" point of sale device technology could be in a vending machine.
